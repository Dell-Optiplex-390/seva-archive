## \*\*<ins>Building the kernel.</ins>

Building the kernel is easy with rust, once building - rust will automatically download required dependencies or any packages needed.

To build Seva - run the following:

```
cargo build
```

## \*\*<ins>Running the kernel.</ins>

Running the kernel is also straightforward, running the kernel will boot you into a QEMU live session - therefore you need QEMU installed.

To run Seva - run the following:

```
cargo xrun
```

## **<ins>Testing the kernel.</ins>**

We at Zenpto promote change, if you've added onto our kernel we've provided tools to allow you to thoroughly troubleshoot if any logic errors occur.

**<ins>(If you've made a great improvement on our kernel, help our project by sending a push request)</ins>**

**Troubleshooting not yet implemented, come back later...**
