## **What is it?**

Seva is a rust based kernel, that works as our future foundation for the full operating system (also known as Seva).

## **Why?**

We believe Rust has huge potential, the major benefits make us believe that the current operating
system commune should face a fundamental rewrite. It would be better to address this now, rather than later down the line.

We are already seeing progress with using Rust as the foundations of Operating Systems

## **Our Philosophy**

Seva - The act of a selfless service without expectation of a reward. Operating Systems shouldn't expect something from you, such as data, as a result from usage of a simple operating system. We at Uquinix don't expect that, your data is yours; nobody elses.
